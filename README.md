How to register as an overseas Indian voter

These are the steps I followed to register as an overseas voter via the Election Commision of India's online voter services portal. Once the application is submitted, there is a lengthy verfication process (https://ecisveep.nic.in/voters/overseas-voters/)
My application is yet to be verified, so take this information with a grain of salt. 

You can also register by posting the application to the ERO of your constituency. For this, the documents need to be attested by a 'competent official in the Indian Mission'. 

## STEP 1 - FINDING YOUR CONSTITUENCY 
Form 6A asks you to specify your assembly constituency, which was a pain in the ass to identify. 
If you're not sure which constituency you should vote in, try this -

Click on the search button on the top left and enter your pincode. Zoom in until you can read the label - this is your assembly constituency. 
This map has the assembly constituency boundaries from the 2011 delimitation. If your state conducted a delimitation exercise post-2011 (Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Assam), these boundaries will no longer apply. 
Double check the constituency using the maps provided by the election authorities of your state. 
Note that the form requires the assembly constituency, not the parliamentary constituency.
