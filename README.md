How to register as an overseas Indian voter
Isabella Gupta

These are the steps I followed to register as an overseas voter via the Election Commision of India's online voter services portal. Once the application is submitted, there is a lengthy verfication process (https://ecisveep.nic.in/voters/overseas-voters/)
My application is yet to be verified, so take this information with a grain of salt. 

You can also register by posting the application to the ERO of your constituency. For this, the documents need to be attested by a 'competent official in the Indian Mission'.
