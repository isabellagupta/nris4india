# How to register as an overseas Indian voter
### January 2024 

These are the steps I followed to register as an overseas voter via Form 6A on the Election Commision of India's online voter services portal. Once the application is submitted, there is a lengthy verfication process ([https://ecisveep.nic.in/voters/overseas-voters/)](https://ecisveep.nic.in/voters/overseas-voters/)).
<br/>
<br/> **FYI I'm still waiting for my application to be processed so I have no idea if I registered correctly. Lol.**

You can also register by posting the application to the Election Registeration Office of your constituency. For this, the documents need to be attested by a 'competent official in the Indian Mission'. 

## STEP 1 - FIND YOUR CONSTITUENCY 
Form 6A requires your assembly constituency, which was a pain in the ass to identify. 
<br/>
<br/> If you're not sure which constituency you are eligible to vote in, try this - 

[https://isabellagupta.github.io/ac-2011](https://isabellagupta.github.io/ac-2011/)
Click on the search button on the top left and enter your pincode. Zoom in until you can read the label - this is your assembly constituency. 
<br/>
<br/> This map has assembly constituency boundaries from the 2011 delimitation. If your state conducted a delimitation exercise post-2011 (Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Assam, etc), these boundaries will no longer apply. 
<br/>
<br/> Double check the constituency using the maps provided by the election authorities of your state, these are usually easily available online. 
<br/>
If you know someone who lives in your constituency, you might be able to identify it using [https://electoralsearch.eci.gov.in/](https://electoralsearch.eci.gov.in/) instead.
<br/>
<br/> **Note:** You need to specify the assembly constituency in the form, not the parliamentary constituency.

## STEP 2 - CREATE AN ACCOUNT ON THE ECI WEBSITE 

Click on 'Fill Form 6A' on [https://voters.eci.gov.in](https://voters.eci.gov.in). This will take you to a login page. Navigate to 'sign up'. Sign up using your email address. 
<br/>
<br/> **Note:** Sometimes, the OTP does not get sent out for hours, by which time the sign up page times out. If you don't receive the OTP, try again in a few hours/the next day. 

## STEP 3 - FILL IN FORM 6A

Once you've signed up, log in, and fill in Form 6A. Keep this information handy - 
* Address
* Constituency name
* Passport details and copy
* Passport photo
* Visa details

## STEP 4 - ALL DONE

Once you submit, you will be assigned an application number. Copy this and save it somewhere - you will need it to track your application status. It's also available in the PDF of the form but is impossible to copy from there. Download the PDF copy of the completed form. You can now track your application status at [https://voters.eci.gov.in](https://voters.eci.gov.in/home/track)
